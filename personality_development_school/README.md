# Recommender System: Identifying Client Needs for a Personal Development School

Project Overview

(Note: This project was created in 2017)

## This project is a recommendation system designed to analyze client interactions and identify:
	1.	Courses that may benefit the client
	2.	The client‚Äôs willingness to purchase recommended courses
	3.	The potential budget the client is willing to spend
    
At each stage, the system assigns a probability to its predictions, such as:    
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe client is likely ready to purchase courses.‚Äù    
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe client is definitely ready to purchase courses.‚Äù    
    
This is the first version of the system.
### For an overview, check out the demo screenshots in the [Demo_Screenshots](https://github.com/shereshevskiy/myprojects/tree/master/personality_development_school/%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BE_%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B) folder
    
## Key Features

	1.	The system‚Äôs recommendations are based on analyzing client correspondence and can:
	‚Ä¢	Be displayed on web pages customized for each potential client.
	‚Ä¢	Assist customer support teams during client interactions.
	2.	Demo screenshots of the system‚Äôs interface are available in the Demo Screenshots folder.
	3.	The system‚Äôs mathematical logic is implemented in Python 3, while the interface page is built using the Bootstrap framework.

## How to Run the Demo

Prerequisites
